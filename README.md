Hey everyone who checks this out! Just a notice if you decide to check out the actual JS code for the chess site;
1. There are definitely waaay better ways to have written it, such as using more functions to cut down on repeat code.
2. The reason there are so many lines of repeated code is because I wanted to get it done, and so I did a TON of copy/paste with code I already wrote.
3. I might eventually come back to this and fix it up, but don't have any plans to right now. It works as intended (AFAIK), and I have other side projects I'm working on that I want to spend more time on.

Thank you so much for checking it out though, and let me know if you have any thoughts/questions/ideas/improvements/problems/etc. Any feedback will probably give me the energy to work on it again, at least a little bit!
